This is a backend for a project called RanktoPP, written in NodeJS 

server.js has a few endpoints available that my [frontend](https://github.com/reigenatk/ranktoppv1) uses for getting current PP (performance point) staistics 

getpp.js interacts with the official [osu! API v2](https://osu.ppy.sh/docs/index.html) in order to get live data about current global rankings, once per day!
